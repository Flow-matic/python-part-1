# Please Enter A Number: 4
# Number is Less Than 5

# Please Enter A Number: 6
# Number Exceeds 5

# Please Enter A Number: 5
# Number Is 5

# Please Enter A Number: 3
# Number is Less Than 5
# Number Is 1 or 3

# The if: elif: else: sequence is the Python equivalent of the switch or case statements found in other languages.
